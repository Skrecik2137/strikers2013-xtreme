# Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 Xtreme
This repository contains all of the code used in the Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 Xtreme game mod.

It uses a modified version of [Kamek](https://github.com/Treeki/Kamek) and [Syati](https://github.com/shibbo/Syati/) to be able to compile custom code and link to existing functions in the game.
